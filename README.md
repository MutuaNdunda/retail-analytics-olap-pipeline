# retail-analytics-olap-pipeline
End-to-end customer segmentation pipeline for a Kenyan retail chain â€” from OLTP streaming to OLAP analytics, data warehousing, and actionable insights.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering and analytics solution for a Kenyan retail chain. It streams transactional data from OLTP systems into an AWS S3 data lake, applies compression and transformation, loads curated data into a SQL-based OLAP warehouse (BigQuery/SQL Server), and performs customer segmentation using clustering algorithms.
The final output includes an interactive Power BI dashboard for slicing, dicing, and visualizing key customer segments to support data-driven marketing and retail strategy.
